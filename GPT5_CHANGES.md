# GPT-5 Integration - What's New

## Summary

Your AI Bot Builder platform now has **full support for OpenAI's GPT-5 reasoning models**! ðŸŽ‰

## What Changed

### 1. New Models Available

You can now use these GPT-5 models in your bots:
- **gpt-5** - Most intelligent, best for complex tasks
- **gpt-5-mini** - Balanced speed and capability
- **gpt-5-nano** - Fast, high-throughput
- **gpt-5-chat-latest** - Latest chat-optimized version

### 2. New Bot Settings (GPT-5 Only)

When creating a bot with a GPT-5 model, you can now configure:

**Reasoning Effort** (Controls how much the model "thinks")
- Minimal - Fastest responses
- Low - Quick with basic reasoning
- Medium - Balanced (default)
- High - Most thorough reasoning

**Text Verbosity** (Controls response length)
- Low - Concise responses
- Medium - Balanced (default)
- High - Detailed explanations

### 3. Automatic API Routing

The platform now automatically detects when you're using a GPT-5 model and:
- Routes to OpenAI's new **Responses API** (instead of Chat Completions)
- Formats the request correctly for GPT-5
- Handles conversation history properly
- Works seamlessly with RAG and session memory

### 4. Updated Admin UI

The admin dashboard now shows GPT-5 options:
- GPT-5 models appear in the model dropdown when OpenAI is selected
- Reasoning effort and verbosity settings appear for GPT-5 models
- Helpful tooltips explain what each setting does

## Files Changed

### Backend
- `app/models/bot.py` - Added `reasoning_effort` and `text_verbosity` fields
- `app/schemas/bot.py` - Added GPT-5 parameters to schemas
- `app/services/chat_service.py` - Added GPT-5 Responses API integration

### Frontend
- `app/static/admin.html` - Added GPT-5 model options and settings UI

### Documentation
- `GPT5_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive GPT-5 guide (NEW)
- `README.md` - Updated to mention GPT-5 support
- `QUICK_START.md` - Updated with GPT-5 examples
- `GPT5_CHANGES.md` - This file (NEW)

### Migration
- `migrate_gpt5.py` - Database migration script (NEW)

## For Existing Users

If you already have the platform running:

### Option 1: Fresh Install
If you haven't created any bots yet:
1. Delete your database: `rm data/botbuilder.db`
2. Restart the server: `./start.sh`
3. Database will be recreated with GPT-5 support

### Option 2: Migrate Existing Database
If you have existing bots you want to keep:
1. Run the migration script: `python migrate_gpt5.py`
2. Restart the server: `./start.sh`
3. Your existing bots will have default GPT-5 settings

## For New Users

Everything is ready to go! Just:
1. Run `./start.sh`
2. Create a bot with a GPT-5 model
3. Configure reasoning effort and verbosity
4. Deploy!

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **100% backward compatible**

- Existing bots continue to work exactly as before
- GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 bots work unchanged
- Claude bots work unchanged
- No breaking changes to the API
- New fields have sensible defaults

## How to Use GPT-5

### Quick Example

1. Open admin dashboard: http://localhost:8000/admin
2. Click "Create New Bot"
3. Select:
   - Provider: OpenAI
   - Model: gpt-5
   - Reasoning Effort: Medium (or Minimal for speed)
   - Text Verbosity: Medium (or Low for concise)
4. Add your OpenAI API key and system prompt
5. Save and deploy!

### Recommended Settings by Use Case

**Fast Code Generation:**
```
Model: gpt-5-nano
Reasoning: Minimal
Verbosity: Low
```

**General Chatbot:**
```
Model: gpt-5-mini
Reasoning: Low
Verbosity: Medium
```

**Complex Problem Solving:**
```
Model: gpt-5
Reasoning: High
Verbosity: High
```

## Key Differences from GPT-4

1. **Reasoning Models**: GPT-5 "thinks" before responding
2. **No Temperature**: Use reasoning effort and verbosity instead
3. **Better at**: Code, complex reasoning, multi-step tasks
4. **Different API**: Uses Responses API (handled automatically)

## Cost Considerations

GPT-5 tokens:
- **Reasoning tokens**: Generated during "thinking" (controlled by effort)
- **Output tokens**: Generated in response (controlled by verbosity)

To minimize costs:
- Use gpt-5-mini or gpt-5-nano when possible
- Use minimal/low reasoning for simple tasks
- Use low verbosity for concise responses

## Testing Checklist

If you want to verify everything works:

- [ ] Admin dashboard loads
- [ ] Can select GPT-5 models in dropdown
- [ ] Reasoning effort field appears for GPT-5
- [ ] Text verbosity field appears for GPT-5
- [ ] Can create a GPT-5 bot
- [ ] Can chat with GPT-5 bot
- [ ] Responses are generated correctly
- [ ] Conversation memory works
- [ ] Can edit GPT-5 bot settings
- [ ] Existing non-GPT-5 bots still work

## Troubleshooting

### "Column reasoning_effort does not exist"
Run the migration: `python migrate_gpt5.py`

### "responses.create not found"
Update OpenAI SDK: `pip install --upgrade openai`

### GPT-5 settings don't appear in UI
Clear browser cache and refresh

### Existing bots not working
They should work fine - if not, check logs for errors

## What's Next?

Explore the capabilities of GPT-5:
- Try different reasoning levels for your use case
